# HR-Analytics-using-PowerBI

In this HR Analytics project, I focused on identifying the key factors contributing to employee attrition within a company. The primary objective was to understand why employees were leaving and how to address these concerns to retain top talent. Through data analysis and insights, I identified several critical drivers of attrition.

Key Performance Indicator:
ðŸ”¸ Employee Count: 1470
ðŸ”¸ Average Salary: 6.5K
ðŸ”¸ Attrition Count: 237
ðŸ”¸ Attrition Rate: 16.1%
ðŸ”¸ Average Years at Company: 7
ðŸ”¸ Average Age: 37

**Key steps and achievements included:**

1)Identifying Key Factors to Reduce Attrition: By analyzing employee data, I identified major drivers of attrition, such as job role, education, salary, and years at the company. These insights enabled the company to target areas for improvement to reduce turnover.

2)Improving the Hiring Process: Through attrition pattern analysis, I refined the recruitment process to ensure better alignment between candidates and company culture, resulting in more informed hiring decisions and reduced early turnover.

3)Enhancing Employee Experience: I proposed initiatives to improve employee satisfaction, including career development opportunities, optimizing work-life balance, and fostering a supportive, inclusive culture.

4)Boosting Workforce Productivity: Recommendations were made for training programs and performance management systems to enhance employee engagement and overall productivity.

5)Building Employee Trust: Data-driven insights led to strategies for increasing transparency and communication, fostering stronger trust between employees and management.

**Key Findings from Analysis:**

The analysis revealed that employees aged 26-35, with salaries up to 5K, education in Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing, and working in roles such as Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Sales Representative, were more likely to leave the company.
These employees had been with the company for less than two years, were mostly male, and represented a significant portion of the attrition.
