# HR-Analytics-using-PowerBI

In this HR Analytics project, I focused on identifying the key factors contributing to employee attrition within a company. The primary objective was to understand why employees were leaving and how to address these concerns to retain top talent. Through data analysis and insights, I identified several critical drivers of attrition.

Key Performance Indicator:
ðŸ”¸ Employee Count: 1470
ðŸ”¸ Average Salary: 6.5K
ðŸ”¸ Attrition Count: 237
ðŸ”¸ Attrition Rate: 16.1%
ðŸ”¸ Average Years at Company: 7
ðŸ”¸ Average Age: 37

Key steps and achievements in the project included:

1)Identifying Key Factors to Reduce Attrition: Through comprehensive analysis, I identified major drivers of attrition, such as job role, education, salary, and years at the company, which allowed the company to target specific areas for improvement.

2)Improving the Hiring Process: By evaluating attrition patterns, I helped refine the recruitment process to better match candidates with the company's values, culture, and growth opportunities, which in turn reduced early turnover.

3)Enhancing Employee Experience: I proposed and implemented strategies aimed at improving employee satisfaction by offering career development opportunities, optimizing work-life balance, and fostering a more inclusive and supportive workplace culture.

4)Boosting Workforce Productivity: Targeted interventions, such as training programs and performance management frameworks, were recommended to improve employee performance and engagement, which contributed to a more productive workforce.

5)Building Employee Trust: Data-driven insights were used to recommend transparency and communication strategies, which helped increase trust between employees and leadership.

Visualizations were created to support the findings, including:

Attrition by Job Role: Breakdown of attrition by job roles
Attrition by Education: Analysis of attrition rates by educational background
Attrition by Age Group: Insights into attrition distribution across different age groups
Attrition by Years at Company: Trends in attrition based on tenure
Attrition by Salary Slab: Breakdown of attrition by salary range
Attrition by Gender: Gender-based attrition analysis
Job Role Breakdown by Attrition Years: Detailed attrition matrix showing trends across job roles over time

These visualizations and insights helped create a targeted strategy to reduce turnover and foster a more engaged and productive workforce, ultimately improving retention and employee satisfaction.
